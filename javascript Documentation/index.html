            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Javascript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.It is a small and lightweight language.
                Inside a host environment(for example, a web browser),JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of object,such as array Date, and Math,and a core set of language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;for example: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM).For example,client-side extensions allow an application to place element
                    on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse click ,form input,and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying abjects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extentions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A General understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web(WWW).</li>
                <li>
                    good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language(HTML)
                </li>
                <li>Some programming experience.if you are new to programming,try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript. </li>

            <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some way but fundamentally different in some others.The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follow most Java Expression syntax, naming conventions and basic controls-flow constructs which was
                the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. </p>
            <p>in contrast to Java's Compile-time system of classes built by declaration,JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                model.The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                requirements. functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>
                javaScript is a very free-from language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variable,
                classes, and methods.You do not explicitly typed.

        <section class="Hello" id="Hello World">
            <h3>Hello world</h3>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript code:</p>
            <div>
                <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alter("Hello"+ yourName);}</p>
                <p>greetMe("World");</p>
            </div>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables">
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers,conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore(_), or dollar sign($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as a and u in identifiers.You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples od legal names are Number_hits, temp99,
                and _name.</p>
